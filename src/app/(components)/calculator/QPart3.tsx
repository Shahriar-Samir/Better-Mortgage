                <h1>Next steps to buying a house</h1>
                <p>There are 8 steps to buying a house and by using this calculator you’ve completed step 2 (calculating your home affordability) and maybe even step 1 (getting your finances in order).</p><br></br>
                <p>The next step is getting pre-approved. A mortgage pre-approval with Better Mortgage takes as little as 3-minutes and doesn’t impact your credit score. It’s a free, no-commitment way to see how much home you can buy, the mortgages you qualify for, and the range of interest rates you’ll be offered.</p><br></br>
                <p>
                If you’re ready to buy a home now, our definitive home buying checklist can walk you through everything you need to know to get the home you want. With your Better Mortgage pre-approval letter in hand, you’ll be able to show sellers and real estate agents that you mean business—giving you an edge over homebuyers that don’t have this kind of proof that they’re financially ready to purchase. And by working with an agent from Better Real Estate and funding with Better Mortgage, you’ll save $2,000 on closing costs, and save up to $8,200 on average over the life of your loan.**
